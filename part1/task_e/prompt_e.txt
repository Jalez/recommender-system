Implement two group recommendation aggregation methods in Python using the predictions from the user-based collaborative filtering approach:

1. **Average Method**:
   - Compute the group's rating for each movie by averaging the predicted ratings from all group members.
   - Provide code and an example of how to generate group recommendations using this method.

2. **Least Misery Method**:
   - Compute the group's rating for each movie by taking the minimum predicted rating among all group members.
   - Provide code and an example of how to generate group recommendations using this method.

Include explanations and comments in the code.
