Explanation

## Average Method

**Group Rating Calculation:**

We iterate over each movie (movie_ids) and predict the rating for each user in the group (group_users) using the `predict_rating` function.

We calculate the average of these predicted ratings using `np.nanmean()`. This function helps to handle any NaN values resulting from missing predictions.

**Sorting:**

The movies are sorted by their average predicted rating in descending order, and the top N movies are returned.

**Use Case:**

This method provides a balanced recommendation that equally reflects the preferences of all group members. It’s useful when every group member's opinion should contribute evenly to the recommendation.

## Least Misery Method

**Group Rating Calculation:**

Similar to the Average Method, we iterate over each movie and predict the rating for each user in the group.

We calculate the minimum rating among group members for each movie using `np.nanmin()`. This ensures that we do not recommend a movie that a member might strongly dislike.

**Sorting:**

The movies are sorted by their least misery rating in descending order, and the top N movies are returned.

**Use Case:**

This method aims to avoid dissatisfaction within the group by considering the worst-case rating scenario. If a movie has even one poor predicted rating, it will affect the overall recommendation significantly. This approach is ideal for situations where a negative experience for even one group member should be avoided (e.g., family viewing).

**Example Usage**

Input:

- Group Users: [1, 2, 3] (three users in the group)
- Movie IDs: We use the first 20 unique movies in the dataset for simplicity.

Output:

- Average Method: Returns the top 5 movies with the highest average predicted rating for all group members.
- Least Misery Method: Returns the top 5 movies with the highest minimum predicted rating across all group members, ensuring no user is likely to dislike the movie.

**Practical Considerations**

**Handling Missing Ratings:**

Using `np.nanmean()` and `np.nanmin()` allows us to handle cases where predictions for some users may not be available (NaN). This makes the functions robust in scenarios where some users haven't rated many movies.

**Extensibility:**

The code can easily be extended to consider more group aggregation methods such as Most Pleasure Method (using the maximum predicted rating) or Majority Vote Method (using the median predicted rating).

**Summary**

- Average Method gives a balanced view by considering every group member equally. It’s useful for scenarios where the goal is to reach a consensus that maximizes the overall group satisfaction.

- Least Misery Method focuses on avoiding a negative experience by making sure that the worst-off member's preferences are respected. It is more conservative and aims to minimize dissatisfaction in group settings.
