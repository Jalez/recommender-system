Using Python and relevant libraries (e.g., pandas), write code to:

- Download and read the MovieLens 100K dataset files 
- Display the first few rows of each dataset to understand their structure.
- Count and display the number of ratings (rows) in the `u.data` file to confirm that there are 100,000 entries.

Provide the code with explanations and comments for each step.
