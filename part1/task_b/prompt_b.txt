Implement a function in Python to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between two users based on their movie ratings in the MovieLens 100K dataset. The function should:

- Accept two user IDs as input.
- Handle cases where users have no movies rated in common.
- Return the similarity score between the two users.

Provide the code with explanations, including any necessary data preprocessing steps.
