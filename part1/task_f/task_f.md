## Explanation of Code

To incorporate a metric that quantifies disagreements within a group, we'll use the standard deviation of predicted ratings for each movie. This will help us gauge how much group members disagree on a movie's predicted rating. If a movie has a high disagreement among users, it indicates divergent tastes within the group, which should be taken into account when forming group recommendations.

## Approach

**Define a Disagreement Metric:** We'll use the standard deviation of predicted ratings for each movie as the measure of disagreement among group members.

**Adjust Aggregated Ratings Based on Disagreement:**

- For each movie, we'll adjust the aggregated rating (from methods like Average Method or Least Misery Method) based on the disagreement metric.
- The adjusted rating will penalize movies with high disagreement to reduce their chances of being recommended.

**Method for Producing Group Recommendations:**

Combine the disagreement metric with a base recommendation method (e.g., Average Method).
Movies with a lower standard deviation (i.e., less disagreement) will have a higher adjusted rating.

Why This Method is Useful

- **Respect Group Consensus:** By incorporating the disagreement metric, we ensure that movies with high disagreements are less likely to be recommended, thereby improving the chances that the whole group enjoys the recommendation.
- **Balanced Recommendations:** This method seeks to balance between group members' satisfaction and minimizing potential dissatisfaction due to differing tastes.

## Calculating the Disagreement Metric

The `calculate_disagreement()` function calculates the standard deviation of predicted ratings for a given movie among group members. It uses `np.nanstd()` to handle cases where some predictions are missing (NaN values). The standard deviation provides a measure of how much disagreement exists among group members for a given movie.

## Adjusted Average Method

The `group_recommendations_adjusted_method()` function follows these steps:

1. Compute the average predicted rating for each movie (`avg_rating`).
2. Compute the disagreement for each movie (`disagreement`).
3. Calculate the adjusted rating as `avg_rating - (alpha * disagreement)`.
4. The `alpha` parameter controls how much weight the disagreement metric has in adjusting the final score. A higher value of `alpha` gives more weight to disagreement, penalizing movies with high disagreements more heavily.
5. Finally, sort the movies by their adjusted ratings and return the top N.

## Example Usage

- Group Users: [1, 2, 3] are the users in the group.
- Movie IDs: We use the first 20 unique movies in the dataset for simplicity.
- The function returns the top 5 recommended movies based on the adjusted rating that accounts for disagreement.

## Why This Method is Useful

### Respecting Group Dynamics:

In real-life scenarios, group members often have diverse tastes. If a movie generates high disagreement, it indicates that some members may strongly dislike it, and hence it should be less favored. By penalizing the average rating of movies with high disagreement, the method aims to provide recommendations that are more acceptable to all members.

### Balancing Satisfaction:

The `alpha` parameter allows for control over the level of disagreement that affects the recommendation. This allows for flexibility based on the group’s tolerance for diverse tastes. If a group values consensus highly, a higher `alpha` can be used, resulting in recommendations with lower disagreement. Conversely, a lower `alpha` might be used if the group is more tolerant of differing opinions.

### Fair Recommendations:

This method helps ensure that the final recommended movies are those that, on average, satisfy the group, while also minimizing the risk of significant dissatisfaction for some members. It balances between high average satisfaction and low disagreement.

## Practical Considerations

### Parameter Tuning (`alpha`):

The value of `alpha` can be tuned based on the group’s preferences. A larger group with diverse tastes may benefit from a higher `alpha`, while a smaller, more homogenous group may use a lower `alpha`.

### Extending to Other Aggregation Methods:

While this method is applied to an adjusted average method, it can easily be extended to other aggregation techniques like Least Misery or Most Pleasure by simply modifying how the aggregated score is calculated.

## Summary

The Adjusted Average Method considering Disagreement provides a group recommendation strategy that balances the overall predicted ratings with the level of disagreement among group members. This ensures that the recommended movies are not only highly rated on average but are also agreeable to most members of the group, leading to fairer and more satisfactory group recommendations.
