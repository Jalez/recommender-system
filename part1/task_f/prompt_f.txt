Define a metric in Python to quantify disagreements between users in a group (e.g., standard deviation of predicted ratings for each movie). Then, propose and implement a method that:

- Incorporates this disagreement metric into the group recommendation process.
- Adjusts the aggregated movie ratings to account for high disagreement levels.
- Provides fair and satisfactory recommendations for the group.

Explain why this method is useful for producing group recommendations. Include code, detailed explanations, and examples.

Additionally, prepare content for a 5-slide presentation covering:

- Introduction to the problem of disagreements in group recommendations.
- The disagreement metric you defined.
- How your method integrates the disagreement metric.
- Results showing improved group recommendations.
- Conclusion and potential future work.

Provide the presentation content in bullet points for each slide.
