Design a new method in Python to produce diverse sequential group recommendations using the MovieLens 100K dataset. The method should:

- Promote diversity in the recommended movies while maintaining relevance.
- Incorporate techniques such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) or topic diversification.
- Explain how the method works and why it is effective for sequential group recommendations.

Provide detailed explanations and any assumptions made.
