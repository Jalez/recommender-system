Part IV: Counterfactual Explanations for Groups
Due: November 30, 2024

## 1. Understanding Counterfactual Explanations

**Action:** Study how counterfactuals are generated for individual users.

**Implementation:**

- Identify challenges unique to groups, such as fairness and privacy.

## 2. Designing the Method (10 points)

**Action:** Develop a method that:

- Considers the collective interactions of the group.
- Ensures explanations are group-centric rather than user-specific.

**Implementation Ideas:**

- Group-Based Perturbation: Remove items commonly liked by the group to see the effect on recommendations.
- Fairness Constraints: Ensure no single user's data disproportionately affects the explanation.

**Characteristics to Adhere To:**

- Anonymity: Explanations should not reveal individual preferences.
- Collective Responsibility: Highlight how the group's overall behavior influences recommendations.

## 3. Implementing the Method (10 points)

**Action:** Code the method within your recommendation system.

**Implementation:**

- Use group interaction histories.
- Generate explanations like, "Because the group enjoyed movies X and Y, movie Z is recommended."
