Implement the group counterfactual explanation method you designed in Task 15. The implementation should:

- Use the group's interaction history to identify influential items.
- Generate explanations such as "If the group had not liked items A and B, then item C would not have been recommended."
- Ensure that explanations are fair and group-centric.

Provide code with explanations, examples, and comments.
