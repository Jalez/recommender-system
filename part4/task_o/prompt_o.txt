Design a method in Python to generate counterfactual explanations for group recommendations using the MovieLens 100K dataset. The method should:

- Systematically remove items from the group's previous interactions.
- Determine if the removal affects specific recommendations.
- Ensure explanations do not single out individual users (i.e., avoid using items only one user interacted with).
- Prefer explanations involving items that multiple group members have interacted with.

Explain the characteristics of your method and how it adheres to fairness and privacy considerations in group recommendations.
