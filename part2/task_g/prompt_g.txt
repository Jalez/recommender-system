Design a new method in Python for producing sequential group recommendations using the MovieLens 100K dataset. The method should:

- Account for the sequential nature of user interactions (e.g., time-based weighting of ratings).
- Modify existing collaborative filtering approaches to incorporate sequential information.
- Explain the theoretical background and why this method works well for sequential group recommendations.

Provide detailed explanations and any assumptions made.
