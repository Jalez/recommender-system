Design and implement a new similarity function in Python for computing similarities between users in the MovieLens 100K dataset. Possible options include:

- Cosine similarity adjusted for user rating biases.
- Mean Squared Difference.
- Jaccard similarity for binary preferences.

The function should:

- Accept two user IDs as input.
- Return the similarity score between the two users.

Explain why this similarity function is useful for collaborative filtering, referencing relevant research or literature. Provide code and detailed explanations.
