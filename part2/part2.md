6. Explanation of Why the Method Works Well
   Dynamic Adaptation to User Satisfaction:

By adjusting weights based on satisfaction trends, the method ensures that users who are less satisfied gain more influence in future recommendations.
This dynamic adjustment prevents long-term dissatisfaction for any group member.
Balancing Group and Individual Satisfaction:

The method aims to maximize overall group satisfaction while ensuring that individual preferences are not consistently overlooked.
By considering both group preferences and individual satisfaction trends, it finds a balance between the needs of the group and its members.
Fairness Over Time:

The method ensures that all users have the opportunity to have their preferences reflected in the group recommendations over multiple iterations.
This is crucial in sequential settings where the same group interacts with the system repeatedly.
Adaptability:

User preferences and satisfaction can change over time. The method adapts to these changes by updating weights and cumulative satisfaction at each iteration.
